Well, not really.  
This is just an example app we're building, to showcase PHP's and Laravel's capabilities when building web apps.  
Based on the use case defined [here](https://github.com/uhajzeraj/flossk-php-laravel-course#during-lecturing).

### Setting up

To install the dependencies, run:

```shell
composer install
```

To start the built-in development server, run:

```shell
php artisan serve
```

Alternatively, use something like [**Laravel Valet**](https://laravel.com/docs/valet).
